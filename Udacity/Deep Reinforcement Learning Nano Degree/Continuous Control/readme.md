# Summary
In this report, the result from the navigation project is presdented using a **DDPG**.

## Project's Description 
In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.



### Rewards:
A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location.

### State Space 
The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Actions 
Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

- 0 - move forward.
- 1 - move backward.
- 2 - turn left.
- 3 - turn right.


## Project's goal
the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.





# Rewards Result
This is plot of rewards when training.
At Episode 670, agent performance met the criteria and stopped training.
(The mean score of last 100 episodes is more than +30)

### Exploring the Environment 

#### Step 1: Clone the DRLND Repository
1. Configure your Python environment by following [instructions in the DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies). These instructions can be found in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Readme.md)
1. By following the instructions you will have PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkits, and all the Python packages required to complete the project.
1. (For Windows users) The ML-Agents toolkit supports Windows 10. It has not been test on older version but it may work.

#### Step 2: Download the Unity Environment 
- For this projects you will need to install the Unity environment as described in the [Getting Started section](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p1_navigation/README.md) (The Unity ML-agant environment is already configured by Udacity)

  
1. Check [this nanodegree's prerequisite](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/#dependencies), and follow the instructions.

2. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

#### Step 3: Explore the Environment
After you have followed the instructions above,to train the agent, start jupyter notebook, open Continuous Control.ipynb and execute! For more information, please check instructions inside the notebook.

### Train a agent
There are 2 options for training the Agent:
1. Execute the provided notebook within this Nanodegree Udacity Online Workspace for "project #2  Continuous_Control.ipynb".
1. Or build your own local environment and make necessary adjustements for the path to the UnityEnvironment in the code.

Note: that the Workspace does not allow you to see the simulator of the environment; so, if you want to watch the agent while it is training, you should train locally.

# Running the code:

After setting up the environemnt keep every file as structures in the github repo. Navigate to Continuous_Control.ipynb and run it using a jupyter notebook.
